## Term Project - CS313E

### CS313 E - Elements of Data Analytics


#### 1. Description
The goal of this project assignment is to develop a software project using Python programming, algorithms, and data structures that you have learned in this course. The topic of the project is free and can be any topic from your major study field. For example, you can work on a simple data processing project, access data from any source and process it, develop an application that controls some mockup sensors, a web scraping project, or the calculation of linear algebra operations or differential equations.

The project idea should be original and not copied from any online websites or resources. The project should be new and implemented by the student group.

#### 2. Define a Project *(2 Points)*
Define the project idea and create a project model design. You can use any methods to model your software model, packages, classes, and communication and interactions between them. Describe your project, software model, and its implementation in text form.

You should describe the following items:
1. What is your project idea about?
2. If you use any datasets, describe the dataset and provide how one can access and download it.
3. Describe your design for main packages, classes, methods, functions, and iterations between them.
4. Describe any libraries that you use.
5. Design some Test cases that can test the correctness of your software.
6. What are your current expectations of your software? For example, do you expect that it works well? What are the expected weaknesses?

#### 3. Implementation *(3 Points)*
- You need to implement your project in Python. You are allowed to use any Python libraries, or without using any libraries. If you are using libraries, you need to describe them.
- You can implement your project in Python scripts or use Jupyter Notebooks to implement your project and provide your documentation.
- Your code should be completed and compilable without any errors. The teaching team should be able to read your documentation and run your project.
- Run your implementation on your laptop and generate the results if it generates any results when it runs.
- Provide interpretations of your results.
- What can you do to improve your results? Apply your ideas to improve your results.
- Provide any references that you have used.

**Requirements:**
- You should use at least 2-3 data structures that we have learned in our class. Examples of these data structures are: lists, dictionaries, queues, stacks, heaps, binary search trees, and trees.
- You should use at least one of the algorithm types that we have learned
